üîû DETAILED CONTENT GUIDELINES üîû
```
This server is ‚ÄúPG-13.‚Äù For reference, here‚Äôs a guideline taken from ESRB.
Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language.
**Note:** This server is fairly lax on swearing so long as the language is not sexual.
Refer to: <https://www.esrb.org/ratings/ratings_guide.aspx>

**ALLOWED**
:white_check_mark: Textual sexual attraction
:white_check_mark: Open-mouthed kissing
:white_check_mark: Brief, vague or non-descriptive talk about violence, addiction, and other mature themes **if they are implied or mentioned in passing only. The conversation should NEVER be focussed on them.**

**NOT ALLOWED**
:negative_squared_cross_mark: Calling ship-related/character sexuality headcanons ‚Äúcanon‚Äù. Discussions of these topics are allowed but only in the specific shipping channels (#bl-and-gl or #boy-x-girl)
‚§∑ Example 1: Calling Masumi and Sakyo canonically heterosexual is not appropriate except in #boy-x-girl; saying they canonically show romantic interest in the MC is fine.
‚§∑ Example 2: Calling Tasuku gay is not appropriate except in #bl-and-gl; quoting his 'I'm not interested in women' line for other reasons in regular chats is okay.
:negative_squared_cross_mark: Words used only or primarily in a NSFW context
‚§∑ If the first link/definition on Google when you search for this word is NSFW, don't use it!
:negative_squared_cross_mark: Explicit, lengthy, or detailed discussions relating to mature topics as mentioned above.
:negative_squared_cross_mark: Images of horror, violence, gore, or bodily distortion that may make others uncomfortable. This applies to 2D images such as character edits as well.

# post 8

We have a **word filter** for certain words that are either explicitly sexual or have such connotations.
‚§∑ If your message is spontaneously deleted, this is the cause.
‚§∑ In the event that a moderator deletes a message, they will say so in the chat.

**__Most importantly, we‚Äôd like everyone to be aware that this server is a public space that anyone can view. Please use your best judgement when posting!__**
