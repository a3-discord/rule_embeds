once you've updated the posts you want to update, delete the previous posts in rules-and-links, go to the staff channel and type .refreshRules

also keep in mind:

1) if the character count for any of these text files exceeds 2048 characters, the embed won't send

2) even the slightest syntax errors will cause the embed not to send

3) github is slow and sometimes it can take even 10-15 minutes before the raw content in the text files refresh, so wait a little while before sending the .refreshRules command after making updates to the text files here
