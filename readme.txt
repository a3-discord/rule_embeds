1) find the post you want by colour and make the changes

2) commit the changes

3) manually delete the previous posts in the rules-and-links channel

4) go to the staff-chat channel and type .refreshRules

5) keep in mind:

   - if the character count for any of these text files exceeds 2048 characters, the embed won't send
   - even the slightest syntax errors can cause the embed not to send
   - github is slow and sometimes it can take even 10-15 minutes before the raw content in the text files refresh, so wait a little while before sending the .refreshRules command after making updates to the text files here
